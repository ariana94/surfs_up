## ALOHA!
After a vacation in Hawaii, I have decided I want to live there and open a surf and shake shop! I have found W. Avy as a potential investor. His only concern is the weather having a negative effect on business. Let's take a look at some of the weather data from the island of Oahu.

## My findings
Here is a summary of my findings for June:

And here we have December:

Based on this data we can see that
- June has an avg of 75 and Dec has an avg of 71
- Standard deviation between the two months is only a .5 difference
- The minimum temp in December was 8 degrees colder than June's minimum


## In conclusion
Only 25% of December's days are under 70F. Temp wise, December still has very nice weather and we should not see much of a negative effect from that specifically. Some other queries I would like to run would be on percipation to see how many rainy days there are between the two months. It may also be to our benefit to check only the data that is closest to our shop location, as this would be the most accurate to what weather the beaches near us would experience.
